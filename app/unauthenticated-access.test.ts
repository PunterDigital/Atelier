// The unauthenticated-access boundary for the whole HTTP surface: every URL an
// anonymous visitor could type must either be intentionally public or refuse
// them. Two enforcement styles exist and both are exercised here against the
// real code (PGlite via the getDb() seam, real route handlers, real layouts):
//
//   - Pages are gated by their route-group layout, which redirects to /sign-in
//     when there is no session. This is what stops an anonymous visitor from
//     viewing an expense's receipt, which is embedded (as a data URL) inside
//     the gated /expenses/[expenseId] page - there is no separate receipt URL.
//   - API routes that stream a file (invoice PDF, data export) or speak MCP
//     answer a cookieless request with 401 rather than a redirect.
//
// A structural pass then proves the two live checks above actually cover the
// entire app/ tree: every page.tsx and route.ts is classified, so a newly
// added route that slips outside the auth boundary fails this suite instead of
// shipping unprotected.
