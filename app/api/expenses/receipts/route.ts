// Download every expense receipt whose incurred date falls in [from, to) as
// a single zip - the "hand a month's invoices to the accountant" action.
// Mirrors the tenancy, suspension and permission gates of the tRPC expense
// procedures, resolved against the browser session because a file download
// has to be a plain GET.
//
// The business is derived from the caller's active membership, never from
// the request, so the archive can only ever contain the caller's own data.
//
// `from`/`to` arrive as full ISO timestamps computed by the client in the
// user's own timezone: receipts' incurred dates are stored as local
// midnights (see expense-form.tsx), so the month boundary has to be drawn
// where the user lives, not where the server runs.

// A year plus slack. The archive is built in memory (receipts are capped at
// ~1.5MB each), so an unbounded range is the one way a caller could balloon
// this into an out-of-memory request.
