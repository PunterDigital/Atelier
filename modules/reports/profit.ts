// Profit reporting: income - expenses - what the business pays its team.
// A pure core folds currency-tagged contributions into per-currency buckets,
// and a thin db wrapper assembles those contributions from invoices, expenses
// and the internal cost frozen on billed time entries. Two bases are reported
// side by side:
//   cash    - only money that has actually moved (paid invoices, paid
//             expenses, and the cost of time billed on a paid invoice).
//   accrual - everything recognised (issued invoices, all recorded expenses,
//             and the cost of all billed time, paid or not).
// Money never crosses currencies here (there is no FX in this module): every
// figure stays in the currency it was denominated in, so a EUR-billed /
// USD-paid contractor surfaces as two currency rows. The final subtraction is
// plain integer arithmetic - profit can be negative, so it must not run
// through roundHalfUpDiv (which rejects negatives).
