// settings UI renders from here, and the docs are generated from here - so a
// permission only ever exists in one place.
//
// A permission is a `resource.action` string. Every permission listed here is
// wired to at least one tRPC procedure and covered by the permission matrix
// test (server/trpc/routers/permissions.test.ts); adding one without a gate
// (or a gate without a permission) fails that test.
