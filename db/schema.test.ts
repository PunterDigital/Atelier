// - business is the tenancy root itself
// - user/session/account/verification are Better Auth's tables; users
//   reach business data only through business_member, which is scoped
// - oauth_* are the Better Auth MCP plugin's OAuth tables; an access token
//   carries a user_id, and that user reaches business data only through the
//   business-scoped procedures, never directly
